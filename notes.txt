NOW IN PRESENT I AM LOGGED IN AS sahilbhatiapcacc-cmyk(MY PERSONAL GITHUB ACC)

GIT CODE & NODE is not a repository ...... GIT_Code_-_Notes is a repository so the (.git) file will be in the repo only 

Git is just a version control system that helps to track code.

Commands to chnage the user name or user email:
1. git config global user.name "user_name"
2. git config global user.email "user_email_id_name"
